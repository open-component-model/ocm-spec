# F. Label Definitions

[Artifacts](../../specification/elements/README.md#artifacts),
[references](../../specification/elements/README.md#aggregation) and
[component versions](../../specification/elements/README.md#component-versions)
feature [labels](../../specification/elements/README.md#labels)
with arbitrarily structured values.

The [Open Component Model (OCM)](../../../README.md) allows defining
labels with a predefined meaning not relevant for the interpretation of 
a component descriptor, but for dedicated tool environments. Such label names
feature a namespace.

Labels without a namespace are relevant for the component model itself.

## Model-specific Labels

So far, no centrally predefined labels are defined.

## Tool-specific centrally defined Labels

So far, no centrally predefined labels are defined.
