# Semantic Extension Points of the Open Component Model Specification

The specification is based on two basic extension points for describing semantics
of artefacts:
- Formal artefact types describe the technical meaning of an artefact,
  independent of their technical representation in a blob format (centrally
  defined types are described in [appendix E](../../appendix/E/README.md)).
- Dynamic attribution of artefacts with additional formal information not
  directly described by elements of the Open Component Model is possible
  with labels. The meaning of dedicated label names is globally unique
  (centrally defined label names with their meaning are defined in
  [appendix F](../../appendix/F/README.md)).
