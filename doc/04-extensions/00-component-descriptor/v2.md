# Component Descriptor Serialization Version v2

A *Component Descriptor* of version v2 is a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) or
[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) document according to this
[schema](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/resources/component-descriptor-v2-schema.yaml).
Additional fields are not allowed. Note that the schemas are maintained in a different [Git repository](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/tree/main/resources).

In serialised form, *Component Descriptors* MUST be UTF-8-encoded.
Either YAML, or JSON MUST be used. If YAML is used as serialisation format,
only the subset of features defined by JSON MUST be used,
thus allowing conversion to a JSON representation.

YAML is recommended as preferred serialization format.

YAML permits the usage of comments, and allows different formatting options.
None of those are by contract part of a *Component Descriptor*, 
thus implementations may arbitrarily choose to retain or not retain 
comments or formatting options.

The order of attributes is arbitrary, and MUST NOT be relied upon.

The order of elements in sequences MAY be significant and
MUST be retained in cases where it is significant.

## Schema Version

A *Component Descriptor* document consists of two top level elements: `meta` and `component`

| Field     | Description |
|-----------| ----------- |
| meta      | Contains the schema version of the *Component Descriptor* specification. This document defines schema version *v2*. |
| component | Definition of the artifacts which belong to the component version. |

Example:

```
meta:
  - schemaVersion: "v2"
component:
  ...
```

## Component

The `component` field of a *Component Descriptor* has the following fields:

| Field               | Description |
|---------------------| ----------- |
| name                | Component name |
| version             | Component version |
| repositoryContexts  | Locations of the *Component Descriptor* in a transport chain |
| provider            | Provider of the component, e.g. a company, organization,... |
| sources             | Array of references to sources |
| resources           | Array of references to resources |
| componentReferences | Array of references to other *component versions* described by *Component Descriptors* |
| labels              | Optional field to add additional information/extensions |

### Component Name and Version

Every *Component Descriptor* has a `name` and `version`,
also called component name and component version.
Name and version are the identifier for a *Component Descriptor*
and the component version described by it.

```
meta:
  - schemaVersion: "v2"
component:
  name: ...
  version: ...
```

Component names reside in a global namespace. To avoid name conflicts
component names MUST start with a valid domain name
(as specified by [RFC-1034](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1034),
[RFC-1035](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1035)) followed by an optional URL path suffix
(as specified by [RFC-1738](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1738)).

Examples are:

- *github.com*
- *github.com/pathToYourRepo*

If no URL path suffix is specified, the domain MUST be possessed
by the component owner. If a URL path suffix is specified,
the namespace started by the concatenation of domain and URL path suffix
MUST be controlled by the component owner.

A component name SHOULD reference a location
where the componentâ€™s resources (typically source code,
and/or documentation) are hosted. An example and recommended practise
is using GitHub repository names for components on GitHub like *github.com/pathToYourRepo*.

Component versions refer to specific snapshots of a component.
A common scenario is the release of a component. Component versions MUST
adhere to a loosened variant of [Semver 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Different to strict SemVer 2.0.0, component versions MAY:

- have an optional v(ersion) prefix
- omit the third level (patch-level); if omitted, patch-level is implied to equal 0

The inner elements are described in detail in chapters
[Model Elements](../../01-model/02-elements-toplevel.md)
and [Identifiers](../../01-model/03-elements-sub.md).

### Provider

The provider field may be a simple name or a string containing
a json document describing the provider attributes.
The json document has the following structure:

| Field | Description                                                         |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name  | (required) Provider name                                            |
| labels| list of labels according to the [label specification](../../01-model/07-extensions.md#label-types) |
