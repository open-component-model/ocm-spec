# Blob

## Type Name
**`blob`**

A blob represents any data without a dedicated logical type.

## Format Variants
Any arbitrary media type is used to define the logical and/or technical format of the byte-stream represented by the blob.
By default the media type `application/octet-stream` can be used for an anoymous byte sequence.
