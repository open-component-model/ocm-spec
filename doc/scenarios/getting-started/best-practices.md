## Separate between Build and Publish

Typical automated builds have access to the complete internet ecosystem. This involves
downloading of content required for a build (e.g. `go mod tidy`), but also the upload
of build results to repositories (e.g. OCI image registries).

For enterprise build this approach has several disadvantages:
- there is no control what kind of artifacts are downloaded from the internet.
- there is no guarantee that these artifacts are still available tomorrow, or they might
  be temporarily not accessible.
- the build procedure needs write permissions to external repositories.

The first problem might be acceptable, because the build results may be analyzed by scanners
later to figure out what has been packaged, and triage the results in an asynchronous
step later on.

The second problem is more severe, which could be solved by mirroring the required
artifacts  and instrument the build somehow (technology dependent) to use the local mirror.
Such a mirror could also give back to control the possible input vector of a build by
restricting  the access to the use of the mirror.

This third problems might provide severe security risks, because the build procedure
as well as the downloaded artifacts may be used to catch registry credentials or at least
corrupt the content of those repositories.

This could be avoided by establishing a contract between the build procedure of a
component/project and the build system, providing the build result as a local file
or file-structure. This is then taken by the build system to push content wherever
it should be pushed to. This way the execution of the build procedure does not need
write permissions to any repository, because it never pushes build results.

The Open Component Model supports such processes by supporting filesystem based
OCM repositories, which are able to host any type of content, regardless of its
technology. The task of the build then is to provide such a *CTF* archive for the
OCM component versions generated by the build. This archive can then be
used by the build-system to do whatever is required to make the content accessible
by others.

The composition of such archives is described in the [Getting Started Section](README.md).

To secure further processes, a *certified build-system* could even sign the content with
its build system certificate to enable followup-processes to verify that involved component
versions are provided by accepted and well-known processes.

## Building multi-arch images
At the time of writing this guide Docker is not able to build multi-architecture (multi-arch)
images natively. Instead, the `buildx` plugin is used. However, this implies building and pushing
images in one step to a remote container registry as the local docker image store does not
support multi-arch images.

The OCM CLI has therefore some built-in support for dealing with multi-arch images during the
component version composition ([`ocm add resources`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/docs/reference/ocm_add_resources.md)). This allows
building all artifacts locally and push them in a separate step to a container registry. This
is done by building single-arch images in a first step (still using `buildx` for cross-platform
building). In a second step all images are bundled into a multi-arch image, which is stored as
local artifact in a component (CA) or common transport (CTF)
archive. This archive can be processed as usual (e.g. for signing or transfer to other locations).
When pushed to an image registry multi-arch images are generated with a multi-arch-image manifest.

The following steps illustrate this procedure. For a simple project with a Go binary and a
helm-chart assume the following file structure:

```shell
 tree .
.
├── Dockerfile
├── go.mod
├── helmchart
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   ├── templates
│   │   ├── ...
│   └── values.yaml
└── main.go
```

The dockerfile has the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.19 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod ./
COPY main.go ./
# RUN go mod download
RUN go build -o /helloserver main.go

# Create a new release build stage
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian10

# Set the working directory to the root directory path
WORKDIR /
# Copy over the binary built from the previous stage
COPY --from=builder /helloserver /helloserver

ENTRYPOINT ["/helloserver"]
```

Now we want to build images for two platforms using docker and buildx. Note the `--load` option for
`buildx` to store the image in the local docker store. Note the architecture suffix in the tag to be
able to distinguish the images for the different platforms. Note also that the tag has a different
syntax than the `--platform` argument for `buildx` as slashes are not allowed in tags.

```shell
$ TAG_PREFIX=eu.gcr.io/my-project/acme # path to you OCI registry
$ PLATFORM=linux/amd64
$ VERSION=0.1.0

$ docker buildx build --load -t ${TAG_PREFIX}/simpleserver:0.1.0-linux-amd64 --platform linux/amd64 .

Check that the images were created correctly:
```shell
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                                              TAG                 IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE

eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver   0.1.0-linux-amd64   08641d64f612   About a minute ago   25.7MB
```

In the next step we create a component archive and a transport archive
```shell
$ PROVIDER=acme
$ COMPONENT=github.com/$(PROVIDER)/simpleserver
$ VERSION=0.1.0
$ mkdir gen
$ ocm create ca ${COMPONENT} ${VERSION} --provider ${PROVIDER} --file gen/ca
```

Create the file `resources.yaml`. Note the variants in the image input and the type `dockermulti`:

```yaml
---
name: chart
type: helmChart
input:
  type: helm
  path: helmchart
---
name: image
type: ociImage
version: 0.1.0
input:
  type: dockermulti
  repository: eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver
  variants:
  - "eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0-linux-amd64"
  - "eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0-linux-arm64"
```

The input type `dockermulti` adds a multi-arch image composed by the given dedicated images from the local docker
image store as local artifact to the component archive.

Add the described resources to your component archive:

```shell
$ ocm add resources ./gen/ca resources.yaml
processing resources.yaml...
  processing document 1...
    processing index 1
  processing document 2...
    processing index 1
found 2 resources
adding resource helmChart: "name"="chart","version"="<componentversion>"...
adding resource ociImage: "name"="image","version"="0.1.0"...
  image 0: eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0-linux-amd64
  image 1: eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0-linux-arm64
  image 2: INDEX
locator: github.com/acme/simpleserver, repo: eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver, version 0.1.0
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

The input type `dockermulti` is used to compose a multi-arch image on-the fly. Like
the input type `docker` is reads images from the local docker daemon. In contrast to
this command you can list multiple images, created for different platforms, for which
an OCI index manifest is created to describe a multi-arch image. The complete set
of blobs is then packaged as artifact set archive and put as single resource into
the component version.

The resulting `component-descriptor.yaml` in `gen/ca` is:

```shell
component:
  componentReferences: []
  name: github.com/acme/simpleserver
  provider: acme
  repositoryContexts: []
  resources:

    relation: local
    type: ociImage
    version: 0.1.0
  sources: []
  version: 0.1.0
meta:

```

Note that there is only one resource of type `image` with media-type `application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+tar+gzip`
which is the standard media type for multiarch-images.

```shell
$ ls -l gen/ca/blobs

You can create a transport archive from the component archive.

```shell
cm transfer ca gen/ca gen/ctf
transferring version "github.com/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0"...
...resource 0(github.com/acme/simpleserver/helloserver:0.1.0)...
...resource 1(github.com/acme/simpleserver/eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0)...
...adding component version...
```

Or you can push it directly to the OCM repository:

```shell
$ OCMREPO=ghcr.io/${PROVIDER}
$ ocm transfer ca gen/ca $OCMREPO
transferring version "github.com/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0"...
...resource 0(github.com/acme/simpleserver/helloserver:0.1.0)...
...resource 1(github.com/acme/simpleserver/eu.gcr.io/acme/simpleserver:0.1.0)...
...adding component version...
```

The repository then should contain three additional artifacts. Depending on the OCI registry and
their corresponding UIs you may see that the uploaded OCI image is a multi-arch-image. For example on
GitHub packages you can see under `OS/Arch` that there are two platforms `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64`

For better automation and reuse you may consider templating resource files and makefiles (see below)

## Using Makefiles
Developing with the Open Component Model usually is an iterative process of building artifacts,
generating component descriptors, analyzing them and publishing them. To simplify and speedup this
process it should be automated using a build tool. One option is to use a `makefile`.
The following example can be used as a starting point and can be modified according to your needs.

In this example we will automated the example shown in the sections before:

* Create a multi arch image from Go sources from a Git repository with docker
* Packaging the image and a helm chart into a common transport archive
* Signing and publishing the build result
### Prerequisites

* The ocm CLI must be installed and in the PATH
* The Makefile is in the top-level folder of a Git project
* Operating system is Unix
* A sub-directory `local` can be used for local settings e.g. environment varibles, RSA keys, ...
* A sub-directory `gen` will be used for generated artifacts from the make build
* It is recommended to add `local/` and `gen/` to the `.gitignore` file

We use the following file system layout for this example:

```shell
$ tree .

It supports the following targets:

* `build` (default) simple go build
* `version` show current VERSION of Github repository
* `image` build a local docker image
* `multi` build multiarch images with docker
* `ca` executes build and creates a component archive
* `ctf` create a common transport format archive
* `push` pushes the common transport format to an OCI registry
* `info` shows variables used in makefile (version, commit, etc.)
* `describe` displays the component version in a tree-form
* `descriptor` shows the component-descriptor for this component version
* `transport` transport the component from the upload repository into another OCM repository
* `clean` deletes all generated files (but does not delete docker images)

The variables at the beginning assigned with `?=` can be set from outside and override the default
declared in the makefile. Use either an environment variable or an argument when calling `make`.

Example:

```
$ PROVIDER=foo make ca
```

### Templating the resources
The makefile uses a dynamic list of generated platforms for the images. You can just set the
`PLATFORMS` variable:

```makefile
MULTI     ?= true
PLATFORMS ?= linux/amd64 linux/arm64
```

If `MULTI` is set to `true` the variable `PLATFORMS` will be evaluated to decide which image variants
will be built. This has to be reflected in the `resources.yaml`. It has to use the input type
`dockermulti` and list all the variants which should be aggregated into a multiarch image. This list
depends on the content of the make variable.


The ocm CLI supports this by enabling templating mechanisms for the content by selecting a templater
using the option `--templater ...` . The example uses the [Spiff templater](https://github.com/mandelsoft/spiff).

```makefile
$(GEN)/ca: $(GEN)/.exists $(GEN)/image.$(NAME)$(FLAGSUF) resources.yaml $(CHART_SRCS)
	$(OCM) create ca -f $(COMPONENT) "$(VERSION)" --provider $(PROVIDER) --file $(GEN)/ca
	$(OCM) add resources --templater spiff $(GEN)/ca COMMIT="$(COMMIT)" VERSION="$(VERSION)" \
		IMAGE="$(IMAGE):$(VERSION)" PLATFORMS="$(PLATFORMS)" MULTI=$(MULTI) resources.yaml
	@touch $(GEN)/ca
```

The variables given to the `add resources` command are passed to the templater. The template looks
like:

```yaml
name: image
type: ociImage
version: (( values.VERSION ))
input:
  type: (( bool(values.MULTI) ? "dockermulti" :"docker" ))
  repository:  (( index(values.IMAGE, ":") >= 0 ? substr(values.IMAGE,0,index(values.IMAGE,":")) :values.IMAGE ))
  variants: (( bool(values.MULTI) ? map[split(" ", values.PLATFORMS)|v|-> values.IMAGE "-" replace(v,"/","-")] :~~ ))
  path: (( bool(values.MULTI) ? ~~ :values.IMAGE ))
```

It distinguishes with the variable `values.MULTI` between a single docker image and multiarch image.
With `map[]` the platform list from the makefile is mapped to a list of tags created by the
`docker buildx` command used in the makefile. The value `~~` is used to undefine the yaml fields not
required for the selected case (the template can be used for multi and single arch builds).

```makefile
$(GEN)/image.$(NAME).multi: $(GEN)/.exists Dockerfile $(GO_SRCS)
	echo "Building Multi $(PLATFORMS)"
	for i in $(PLATFORMS); do \
	tag=$$(echo $$i | sed -e s:/:-:g); \
	echo "Building platform $$i with tag: $$tag"; \
	docker buildx build --load -t $(IMAGE):$(VERSION)-$$tag --platform $$i .; \
	done
	@touch $(GEN)/image.$(NAME).multi
```
